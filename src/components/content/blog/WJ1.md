My first week at Actualize was all about establishing a strong foundation for my journey into software development. The focus was on building essential skills, configuring my development environment, and solving beginner-level programming exercises. Here's a recap of what I accomplished during Week 1:

#### **1\. Setting Up My Development Environment**

I started by creating a dedicated folder structure for all my projects:

* Created an `Actualize` folder in my home directory, containing three subfolders. Each folder housed a text file, where I practiced basic terminal commands to manage files and folders.  
* Experimented with the `cat` and `echo` commands to write and display content from files, even using the quirky `| say` command to have my computer read the file aloud.  
* Configured Visual Studio Code (VSCode) by setting up linters and formatters for Ruby, ensuring my code remains clean and readable.

**Key Commands Learned:**  
`ls`, `mkdir`, `cd`, `touch`, `echo`, `cat`, and more.

#### **2\. Diving Into Ruby Basics**

I explored Ruby fundamentals through a series of small exercises, focusing on:

* **Variables and Input/Output:** Writing scripts to interact with users, such as a time traveler prompt asking for a year and responding with a message about the past, present, or future.  
* **Conditionals and Methods:** Debugging and improving exercises like calculating grades or determining if a student is passing based on their average score.  
* **Hashes and Arrays:** Representing data using symbols and exploring Ruby's hash syntaxes.

Bonus: I rewrote some hash-based data structures into classes, which introduced me to object-oriented programming concepts.

#### **3\. Tackling Terminal and API Challenges**

To strengthen my command-line skills, I:

* Completed wargames on [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit0.html), learning to navigate and manipulate the terminal more efficiently.  
* Explored APIs using the `http` gem and HTTPie. I built a basic weather app that fetched real-time weather data from OpenWeather‚Äôs API, displayed temperature and conditions, and added fun features like emojis for rain or sun.

#### **4\. Building Mini Projects**

One highlight of the week was creating a terminal-based app to manage store inventory. Starting with simple hashes, I later refactored the code to use a class structure, allowing for attributes like item name, color, and price to be added and updated dynamically.

**Features Added:**

* Methods to create, read, update, and delete items.  
* Exploring `attr_reader` and `attr_writer` for class attributes.

#### **5\. Collaborative Learning**

Pair programming exercises helped solidify my understanding of Ruby by working with a partner to solve problems like:

* Debugging complex methods.  
* Writing code to calculate the score of a bowling game.

#### **6\. API Exploration**

I explored APIs beyond OpenWeather, experimenting with data from:

* San Francisco food trucks.  
* New York farmers markets.  
* Even Pok√©mon data from [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/) for fun\!

I practiced parsing JSON responses and displaying meaningful data to the terminal.

#### **7\. Productivity and Workflow Tips**

The week closed with tips to improve my workflow:

* Creating shell aliases for frequent Git commands.  
* Using tools like [tldr InBrowser](https://tldr.inbrowser.app/) for quick command-line help.  
* Setting environment variables to store API keys securely.

### **Reflection**

Week 1 was an exciting mix of learning technical skills and building confidence in the basics of software development. From setting up my environment to debugging Ruby code and exploring APIs, every task contributed to my growth. I‚Äôm excited to build upon this foundation and dive into more advanced concepts in the weeks ahead.

Stay tuned for Week 2\! üë®‚Äçüíª
