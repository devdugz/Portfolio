During the New Year's week, the focus was on collaborating on a Resume Application team project. I handled the Rails backend, ensuring the API was robust and met the application's requirements. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### **Team Project: Resume Application**

#### **Backend Development (Ruby on Rails)**

1. **Initial Setup:**  
   * Created a new Rails API application for the project.  
   * Installed necessary gems and configured **CORS** for frontend-backend communication.  
   * Added and seeded the database with **fake data** to simulate real-world application usage.  
2. **Models and Relationships:**  
   * Established `has_many` and `belongs_to` relationships across models:  
     * **Users**: `has_many :experiences, :educations, :projects`  
     * **Experiences, Educations, Projects**: `belongs_to :user`  
3. **User Authentication:**  
   * Added `users#create` (signup) and `sessions#create` (login) actions:  
     * Secure password management using **bcrypt**.  
     * Implemented session-based authentication to manage user logins.  
   * Ensured secure handling of user credentials and sensitive data.  
4. **CRUD Actions for Models:**  
   * Developed **controllers** for:  
     * **Users**:  
       * `index`: Fetch all users.  
       * `show`: Fetch details of a specific user.  
       * `update`: Update user details with a fallback (`||`) condition.  
       * `destroy`: Soft delete user accounts.  
     * **Experiences, Educations, and Projects**:  
       * Full **CRUD** functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete).  
       * Refined `update` actions with fallback conditions for better data integrity.  
5. **Testing:**  
   * Added **controller tests**:  
     * Verified CRUD operations for all models.  
     * Ensured API responses were accurate and as expected.  
6. **Optimizations:**  
   * Addressed potential **N+1 query problems** by leveraging Rails' `includes` method to preload associated data.  
   * Experimented with **pagination** to handle large datasets efficiently:  
     * Users could request paginated results with parameters like `?page=2`.  
7. **Key Features Implemented:**  
   * **JBuilder** for JSON responses:  
     * Streamlined data representation for frontend consumption.  
   * Updated and extended the seeds file:  
     * Added 5 more users with relevant data to mimic realistic scenarios.  
   * Fixed update actions for all models, ensuring consistent and error-free updates.

### **Additional Exercises**

1. **SQL Practice with SQLBolt:**  
   * Completed interactive SQL lessons to strengthen database querying skills.  
   * Focused on query optimization techniques such as filtering, ordering, and limiting results.  
2. **Rails Best Practices:**  
   * Explored solutions for the **N+1 query problem**:  
     * Researched Rails' approach to eager loading and preloading.  
     * Optimized API performance by minimizing the number of database queries.  
   * Studied Rails ActiveRecord pitfalls and applied recommendations to avoid slow queries.  
3. **Collaborative Development:**  
   * Utilized GitHub for team collaboration:  
     * Implemented pull request workflows to ensure clean code merges.  
     * Mob programming sessions for collaborative problem-solving.  
   * Enhanced the repository's **README** to document API endpoints and project details.  
4. **Planning for Final Project:**  
   * Reviewed potential project ideas for the final capstone.  
   * Started brainstorming innovative features and technologies for implementation.

### **New Technologies and Skills**

1. **Advanced Rails Development:**  
   * Learned best practices for building performant Rails APIs.  
   * Enhanced proficiency with Rails testing frameworks.  
2. **Database Optimization:**  
   * Strengthened SQL skills through exercises and debugging real-world issues.  
   * Implemented pagination and eager loading to improve API efficiency.  
3. **Collaboration and Workflow:**  
   * Practiced effective communication and task delegation in a team environment.  
   * Mastered Git workflows with pull requests and code reviews.

### **Takeaways from Week 10**

* **Backend Proficiency**: Delivered a scalable and efficient Rails API with robust CRUD functionality.  
* **Collaborative Coding**: Strengthened teamwork through Git workflows and mob programming.  
* **Optimization Focus**: Gained deeper insights into database and query optimization in Rails.

This week reinforced backend development skills while preparing for future individual and team projects. ðŸš€
