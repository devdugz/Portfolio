This week marked the beginning of the capstone project, where I started developing a full-stack productivity application using React and Ruby on Rails. The app is designed to assist users with task management, study session tracking, and productivity enhancement. Here's a detailed summary:

### **Capstone Project: Productivity App**

#### **Project Overview**

* **Purpose**: A productivity app featuring:  
  * **Pomodoro timer system** for efficient time management.  
  * "Study With Me" sessions using **YouTube's API**.  
  * Comprehensive **task management** functionality.  
* **Technologies**: React (frontend), Ruby on Rails (backend).

### **Development Process**

#### **1\. Planning and Schema Design**

* Created the **schema** in Google Sheets to visualize and validate:  
  * **Tables and attributes**: Users, Tasks, Sessions, etc.  
  * Defined **relationships**:  
    * **Users**: `has_many :tasks`, `has_many :sessions`.  
    * **Tasks**: `belongs_to :user`.  
    * **Sessions**: `belongs_to :user`.  
* Ensured schema integrity with appropriate `id`, `foreign_key`, and constraints.

#### **2\. Backend Development (Rails API)**

1. **Initial Setup**:  
   * Built the Rails backend using the API mode.  
   * Added necessary gems (`bcrypt` for authentication, `jbuilder` for JSON views).  
2. **Models and Associations**:  
   * Defined models:  
     * **User** with authentication (`has_secure_password`).  
     * **Task** and **Session** models with associations.  
3. **Authentication**:  
   * Implemented:  
     * `users#create`: User signup.  
     * `login_sessions#create`: User login with session handling.  
   * Ensured secure password handling using **bcrypt**.  
4. **Controllers and CRUD Operations**:  
   * Created:  
     * **SessionsController**: Manage Pomodoro sessions.  
     * **TasksController**: Handle task CRUD operations.  
   * Added **JSON views** for easy frontend integration.  
   * Tested CRUD functionality using **HTTPie**.  
5. **Testing**:  
   * Installed **Minitest**:  
     * Wrote unit tests for models and controllers.  
     * Ensured the correctness of associations and validations.

#### **3\. Frontend Development (React)**

1. **Setup**:  
   * Used the React CRUD cheat sheet to initialize the app.  
   * Integrated **React Authentication**:  
     * Built components for **Signup**, **Login**, and **Logout**.  
     * Tested authentication flow on the home page.  
2. **Task Management**:  
   * Connected frontend to backend API endpoints.  
   * Created components to manage tasks:  
     * **TaskList**: Display all tasks.  
     * **TaskForm**: Add or edit tasks.  
     * **TaskDetail**: View individual task details.

### **Additional Exercises and Learning**

#### **1\. Testing and TDD**

* Practiced Test-Driven Development (TDD) using Minitest:  
  * Completed exercises for the `Calculator` class:  
    * Wrote tests for **addition, subtraction, multiplication, division**.  
    * Added new methods (e.g., square, power) and their respective tests.  
  * Built a **Coin Machine**:  
    * Wrote a method to convert cents into the minimum number of coins.  
    * Implemented and tested the **FizzBuzz** logic.

#### **2\. SQL Practice**

* Worked through **SQLBolt** exercises:  
  * Focused on advanced queries using `JOIN`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, and `LIMIT`.  
  * Applied insights to backend query optimizations.

#### **3\. Collaboration and Pair Programming**

* Paired with a peer for TDD exercises:  
  * Used a ping-pong approach for testing and implementation.  
* Practiced **mob programming** for collaborative problem-solving.

### **Key Features Built**

1. **Backend API**:  
   * User authentication and session handling.  
   * Full CRUD functionality for tasks and sessions.  
   * JSON responses tailored for React consumption.  
2. **Frontend Features**:  
   * Authentication components (Signup, Login, Logout).  
   * Task management interface.  
3. **Testing**:  
   * Minitest for backend unit and integration tests.

### **Takeaways**

* **Project Planning**: Leveraged schema design tools to plan and validate relationships.  
* **TDD**: Reinforced the habit of writing tests first to guide development.  
* **Full-Stack Development**: Strengthened skills in integrating React with Rails APIs.  
* **Collaboration**: Practiced effective teamwork and communication during exercises.

### **Next Steps**

* Build out additional features for the **Pomodoro timer** and **YouTube integration**.  
* Add frontend styling using **Tailwind CSS**.  
* Deploy the app for demonstration and feedback.

This week set a solid foundation for the capstone project, focusing on robust backend development and seamless front-end integration. ðŸš€
