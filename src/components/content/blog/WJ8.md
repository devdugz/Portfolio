This week was focused on exploring various frameworks, experimenting with third-party libraries, and integrating APIs into applications. Here's a breakdown of the week:

### **React Projects and Libraries**

#### **1\. React Tutorial**

* Followed [Tania Rascia's React Tutorial](https://www.taniarascia.com/getting-started-with-react/) to deepen understanding of React fundamentals:  
  * Explored component structure, JSX, and props.  
  * Halted at the "Pulling in API Data" section.

#### **2\. Experimentation with React Libraries**

* **Libraries Used:**  
  * **`react-calendar`**: Implemented an interactive calendar.  
  * **`react-awesome-button`**: Enhanced UI with animated buttons.  
  * **`react-player`**: Embedded responsive video players.  
* Experimented with libraries from the [Awesome React Components list](https://github.com/brillout/awesome-react-components).

#### **3\. News API Integration**

* Created a **React app** to consume the [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints):  
  * Displayed articles with titles, authors, descriptions, and content.  
  * Implemented a search filter for user-defined queries.  
  * Moved API requests to a Rails backend for secure handling of API keys.

#### **4\. GitHub OAuth Integration**

* Set up GitHub OAuth authentication:  
  * Registered a GitHub OAuth app and configured frontend/backend routes.  
  * Implemented cookies to manage GitHub access tokens securely.  
  * Built a `GitHubProfilePage` to display authenticated user profiles.

#### **5\. React TypeScript Conversion**

* Converted a blog frontend into TypeScript:  
  * Added strong type definitions for props, posts, and API responses.  
  * Used TypeScript to enforce type safety across CRUD actions.  
  * Extended the app with user authentication using TypeScript.

### **Rails Backend Development**

#### **1\. News API Backend**

* Created a **Rails backend** to fetch data from NewsAPI:  
  * Secured API keys using environment variables.  
  * Configured CORS to allow frontend communication.  
  * Added endpoints for fetching and searching articles.

#### **2\. Exploring Third-Party APIs**

* Tested APIs from the [Public APIs list](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis):  
  * Integrated API calls into Rails apps using the `http` gem.  
  * Focused on handling authentication and secure request headers.

#### **3\. OAuth and Secure Authentication**

* Enhanced OAuth capabilities with GitHub:  
  * Used the `http` gem to interact with GitHub's API.  
  * Configured callbacks and profile endpoints to fetch user details.

### **Exploring New Frameworks**

#### **1\. Vue.js**

* Created a **Vue.js app** following [Tania Rascia's tutorial](https://www.taniarascia.com/getting-started-with-vue/):  
  * Explored Vue components and data binding.  
  * Practiced CRUD operations using the [Vue.js CRUD guide](https://github.com/actualize-day-2024-09/resources/blob/main/guide_vuejs3_vite_crud.md).

#### **2\. Ionic Framework**

* Began exploring **Ionic React**:  
  * Experimented with building hybrid web/native mobile apps.  
  * Reviewed the official [Ionic documentation](https://ionicframework.com/docs/react).

### **Problem Solving and CLI Skills**

#### **1\. Balanced Brackets Problem**

* Implemented a solution to validate nested braces in a string using stacks.

#### **2\. CLI-Based Tasks**

* Worked on file reading and parsing for the [Price Combinations Problem](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18wqpooP_-LXwf7y_SIN1tPoZ2CA9GXfTB6YxWums6yA/):  
  * Learned how to process command-line arguments in Ruby.

### **Takeaways from Week 8**

* **Strengthened React expertise**: Experimented with third-party libraries and integrated APIs effectively.  
* **API Security**: Shifted API key handling to the backend for better security practices.  
* **Broadened Framework Knowledge**: Started working with Vue.js and Ionic for diverse frontend capabilities.  
* **Improved Problem-Solving**: Tackled algorithm challenges and learned advanced CLI techniques.

This week was an enriching experience in exploring technologies and building confidence in integrating diverse tools\! ðŸŽ¯
