        About Me
      </h1>
      <p className='text-center text-white/60 md:text-lg'>
        Hey, I'm Connor. I fell in love with tech as a kid, building computers
        and exploring coding languages like HTML and C++ through CodeAcademy. My
        passion for music led me to earn a Bachelor's in Music Business from
        Berklee College of Music. After working in roles like Marketing Coach
        and Music Copyright Researcher, I built a strong foundation in
        analytics, content strategy, and data management.

        However, I found myself wanting to do more with technology and tackle
        more complex problems. This led me to enroll in Actualize BootCamp,
        where I'm now gaining full-stack web development skills in Ruby, Ruby on
        Rails, JavaScript, React, and more. I even built a custom Magic Mirror
        with a Raspberry Pi and a two-way mirror, coding and sharing JavaScript
        widgets for weather, calendars, and more on GitHub. Now, I'm ready to
        use my creativity and skills to make a positive impact.
